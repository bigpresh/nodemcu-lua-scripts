use with my init.lua and wifi.lua files

system.lua loads two components:

- tempsensor-webserver.lua: the webserver which can be asked for a temperature
  reading at any time
- gpio-input-reporter.lua: sets a GPIO interrupt, and fires a HTTP request
  whenever the input goes high, to report door opening events.
